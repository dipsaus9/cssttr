## Week 1
This week we kicked off this awesome project. With some lectures and online information we started coding on a website based on html and css only. This sound pretty easy but it has some challenges for me.
I already knew a lot of css before this project started, so I wanted to challenge myself on different things. One of those things was working with methods and functions I normally don't use, Grid for example.
This was kinda bugging me cause in my opinion css grid isn't that usefull. Don't get me wrong, css grid works great, expect not for my needs (yet). For example when I want to create a grid for 24 news articles I have to tell grid I got 24 columns.
In my opinion flex can take this job way easier. So maybe grid has some options I will use, cause it is very usefull, but now is not the time yet.

This week I created a working file in the src folder. This is where I put all my working js and scss files. I'm working with grunt for a compiler. Grunt will create a css folder which I will use for my index.html and all the other html files.
I created a home page combined with a product page. Next week I'll continue this by adding a about page and a loging page. I think this isn't challenging at all so I need some more challenges.

The most challenging part about this assignment was the radio buttons. I wanted to create a star review where You can see how many stars are active. The problem with this is that there is no way to select a previous element in css. I fixed this by turning the order around using flex.
I created a div around all the radio buttons cause there is no way to use display flex on a fieldset; bug?. So I created a div around the buttons with a display flex property and a row-reverse property to turn them around.
Next I created a complex css part where I select all the input fields after the checked input field. This way I had the oppertunity to style all stars before the active star. I'll try to find some new challenges next week.
